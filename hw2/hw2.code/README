First use X-11 port forwarding if you are using ssh to login to the system. Without this python cannot import pyplot and therfore graphs cannot be plotted. In other words, you should use

ssh -X username@lab1-1.eng.utah.edu

After this login, open a terminal and migrate to the required directory

chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh

The testing has been done on lab1-1.eng.utah.edu machine
